# Final-Project
This code was written for the Final Project in ASTRO 6410 at the University of Utah.  This code demonstrates the ability of PCA to reduce genomic G-quadruplex data and display the data for visual analysis.  The first step of the code is involved in reading in the csv file (which was made using QGRS manager online application).  The next step establishes a function for standardization of data values in the array.  Once the data is run through the standardization, the covariance matrix is computed.  Lastly, the principle components are found, and the data points are plotted on the PCA 1 and PCA 2 axis'.
